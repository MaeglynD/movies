# rota

## Notes
 - I've added vuex but isn't needed at all for this app. Reason being another company asked for a very similar tech test that I wrote days prior, thought I may as well re use the archeticture (from https://github.com/MaeglynD/rota)
 - With commercial software I would spend more time on design, this design is rushed and doesn't look great. Many styling improvements could also be made.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
